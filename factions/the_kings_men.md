# The King's Men

The King's Men is a primarily tiefling crime organization, operating globally. They are involved in any and all crime opportunities. One of their more lucrative ventures is collecting ancient artifacts and selling them to Brimbrook University and other buyers. They have close ties with the Larsalon Historical Society as many prominent members use the King's Men to acquire artifacts for them.

## Emblem

The emblem for the King's Men is a smiling demon wearing a crown, though each chapter has different variations on the demon and crown.

## Origin of the Name

When agents of the King's Men infiltrated groups or places, their classic line was that they were "a king's man", reassuring those that they were about to steal from, and it because such a classic line that the organization adopted it as a name. The name is intended to be reassuring to local authorities, and the King's Men generally assure that the local authorities profit from their presence as long as they turned a blind eye. In regions ruled by a matriarchy, they typically adopt the Queen's Men as their name. Colloquially, they're also known as the Demon Monarchs due to their emblem.

# Regional Operations

## Elsir Vale

The Elsir Vale operation is based out of Little Brimstone, a tiefling neighborhood on the outskirts of Brindol. While members of the King's Men are freely seen in Little Brimstome, the neighborhood itself is kept safe and pristine as most of the dirty business happens elsewhere. The King's Men have a close relationship with the Trask clan that govern Elsircross, so their brothels, gambling houses and fighting pits operate openly there.

### Notable Members

#### Leader - Zaxis "Zax" Borkarin

Finely dressed and with an ornate cane, Zax prefers to not get his hands dirty. He's constantly accompanied by a powerful set of guards.

#### Lieutenant - Skamari "Lashes" Sen

Lashes is a whip-wielding warlock. She's the restless sort, so she's almost constantly out in the field. With both brains and brawn, she's involved in all of Zax's ventures in the region.

#### Lieutenant - Morcin "Big Eye" Tensin

Big Eye has a large, half-globe over his left eye, making it look enlarged. It's assumed to have magical properties, but the details are unknown. Big Eye is an artificer and is valued for his knowledge and skills. He typically relies on his sister, Tomoro, to handle the tasks that require brute force.

#### Lieutenant - Tomoro "Tomo Chop" Tensin

Tomoro, known as "Tomo Chop" due to her big greataxe and her favorite command, is the strongest fighter in the Elsir Vale chapter. She has a famous temper, and she only gets sent on tasks that require pure brute force. Only her brother, Morcin "Big Eye," and Zax have any semblence of control over her. People say that Morcin got her share of the brains and she got his share of the brawn.
