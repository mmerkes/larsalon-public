# Tieflings

The ignorant believe them cursed whereas those fluent in history know that their ancestors made a deal with the demon lord known as Apocalypse centuries ago that brought about the Doomsday Wars. Since that defeat, tieflings have moved to the shadows and outskirts of society with a charismatic leader popping every century or so to conquer, suffer defeat and refresh animosity against their kind all over again. Most tieflings prefer the pursuit of knowledge over the pursuit of power, famously founding Brimstone (now Brimbrook) University in Valindor early in the reign of the Larsalon Empire.

## Tiefling Physical Characteristics
Today, tieflings are typically born from one or more parents of tiefling heritage. In rare cases, both parents may appear as humans, but a recessive gene can be triggered if a child is born with sufficient magical capabilities to draw out the characteristics of their fiendish ancestors.

While tieflings are born with small tails and off-colored skin and typically develop horn nubs in adolescence, their fiendish physical characteristics become more pronounced as they grow in magical power whereas tieflings with more modest gifts or gifts that are left fallow keep their more muted characteristics. Most famous tieflings have large horns and tails, though some tieflings have been able to hide their heritage with carefully styled hair and make up if their magical powers are limited.

## Tiefling Society
Tieflings have long experienced discrimination from humans and other races, and as a result, they often self-segregate. When together, they have their own dialects and idioms, but code-switch when in mixed settings. They have a reputation for intelligence as many are learned, but some consider them conniving and cunning. Tieflings are well known as tutors, and hold leadership positions in most institutions of learning on Larsalon. In some cities, tiefling organized crime is prevalent in many cities.

### True Names
Tieflings guard their true names closely. They know what demons can do with their true names, and more than one tiefling has been betrayed by someone getting close to them to get their name.

### History with Devils and Demons
Throughout the course of history, there have been multiple occasions where fiends have duped tieflings into acquiring terrible power and doing terrible things. The powerful denizens of the lower planes start tracking tieflings as they grow in power and eventually attempt to entice or trick them into doing their bidding.
### Deities
Tieflings have no deities of their own. Most tieflings tend to worship the various gods of knowledge and learning, but there have been some known to secretly worship powerful devils or demons.

## Tiefling Locales

### Brimbrook, formerly Brimstone, University
Brimstone (now Brimbrook) University was founded in the early days of the Larsalon Empire when a group of wealthy tieflings decided to join forces to provide a safe place of learning for young tieflings and increase collaboration in the hoarding of knowledge. The university sent many to the field to collect rare animals and monsters from across the continent and looted the remnants of ancient civilizations to collect artifacts from ages past. While most of the magical artifacts have been sold off, stolen or ransacked over the centuries, the university still have an extensive collection.

The university attempts to stay neutral and distance itself from any tieflings happenings across the continent, but associations are made even when there are none in reality. During the Saryx Revolt where countless died and many cities, towns and villages were burned, Brimstone was unable to distance itself because Saryx and his closest followers were all students at the university. Once the revolt subsided, Brimstone locked its doors and was nearly annihilated. A last minute deal to open the university to non-tiefling students and accept a non-tiefling leader saved the university, and it was reborn as Brimbrook University.

Since the fall of the Larsalon Empire, Brimbook has been amassing artifacts and other knowledge from the empire, trying to save them from pillaging and destruction. Through this effort, the Larsalon Historical Society was born, which is influential across the continent. All major cities and many small cities and towns have satellite branches or members who recruit and organize on their behalf. The primary headquarters is based at Brimbrook.

### Little Brimstone, Elsir Vale
Little Brimstone is a small village situated on the outskirts of Brindol in the Elsir Vale. The community is largely made up of tieflings, but it has a strong contingents of traveling academics, who always receive a warm welcome among the tieflings, and the misfits of human society (monstrous races, etc) that find more comfort without the gazes and harassment they might experience in Brindol proper.

Little Brimstone is historically an academic community that has recently been divided by rising organized crime, led by crime lord Xarvir Barikdral, who has been getting his cronies into the village council through bribery and coercion. The council has not been known for taking action and prosperity as itâ€™s been more intellectual than pragmatic, giving Xarvir an opening for drumming up support by forcing through some populous projects.

While Little Brimstone has no institutions of learning itself, the wealthier residents are known to have accumulated impressive libraries for such a rugged region like the Elsir Vale, and The Hooded Owl has long been a popular respite for wandering scholars and includes an eclectic library of books donated by travelers grateful for the knowledge gained during their stay whole conversing with the great minds that frequent there.
