# Hobgoblins

Some are from one of the famous hobgoblin strongholds, such as Orzeese or Jeha, but they could really be from anywhere. While hobgoblins are not inherently cruel, they are typically bellicose as war and combat are a means to prove their worth and worship their god, Gorsaâ€™alef. Merchants do sometimes hire hobgoblin mercenaries, so their presence is typically tolerated.
