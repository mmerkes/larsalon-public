# Orcs

While orcs are tolerated in cities, they rarely feel welcome, and they must attempt to differentiate themselves from the brethren living the old ways. Tradition dictates that orcs must raid civilization and make war to take lives in battle and gather enough souls to bring back their long dead god. It is believed that once her thirst for blood is satisfied, Burrashat will return to power and take orcs to glory. You might come from a more civilized upbringing with hopes of making a better name for orcs, or you may be escaping the cycle of death in a warmongering tribe.
