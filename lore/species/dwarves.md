## Dwarven Society

While each dwarven clan has a king or clan chief, they are largely a symbolic figurehead. Dwarven society is largely matriarchal in nature, a reflection of the Dwarven pantheon with Bralda the Hearth Mother at the top of the pyramid with Torug the Forge Father and Vistrulda the Arbiter. Clans are ruled by a council, and the most powerful members are typically high ranking clerics of Bralda, predominantly women, who value an efficiently run society and see working toward that goal as the highest devotion to the gods. High ranking clerics of Torug are known to be aloof when it comes to leadership, and the righteous vigor of high ranking clerics of Vistrulda is often easily redirected.
