# Gnolls

The original gnolls came from lost travelers who encountered the Laughing Trickster in a moment of their greatest desperation: exhausted, starved and parched. He offered them a gift that would help them survive, and those who accepted were transformed. While itâ€™s said that the trickster still wanders the world, you were probably born via more conventional means.
