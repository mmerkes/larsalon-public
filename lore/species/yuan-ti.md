# Yuan-ti

Yuan-ti typically pass as a human, but most people can sense a strangeness about you that on closer inspection reveals your serpentine features. Many yuan-ti are thieves and deceivers who favor using poison tipped weapons, and they can often be found in the dark corners or sewers of major cities or in hidden temples to the Devourer. Whether voluntary or not, youâ€™ve experienced the ritual of getting infected with the venom of the Devourer by a high priest.
