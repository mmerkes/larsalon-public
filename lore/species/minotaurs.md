# Minotaurs

Originating from the mysterious Minonesia, known as the Isle of Minotaurs around the world, minotaurs have a knack for navigation and a reputation as infamous pirates. Minotaurs left their labyrinthian cities to sail the high seas and the sightings of their blood red sails strike terror along coasts world wide.

## Minotaur History
It is said the first minotaurs were created by the three gods: Traxanos, the Sea Tyrant, Lokada, the Peacekeeper, and Stako, the Philosopher. At Genisipago, a sacred promontory overlooking the seas, Lokada dripped milk and Traxanos cut his palm to mingle his blood to form the body, and Stako whispered the secrets of life. The first minotaur rose on that hill and founded the great city of Prothen.

Settlements spread across the isle and powerful city-states sprang up. War followed, largely driven by followers of Traxanos. After centuries of brutal warfare, the burning of the Kalamoro Monastery proved to be a turning point. The monks of Stako stayed neutral throughout the conflicts as a matter of doctrine and focused on their philosophical and educational endeavors. The Archon of Nathax demanded their support, and when the abbot refused to take sides, the monastery was ravaged and burned, including the great library at Kalamoro where many cultural treasures were lost forever. After news of the atrocities spread, the First Council of Genisipago was called.

### First Council of Genisipago
High priests of Lokada called all high priests, including those of Traxanos and Stako, and archons of the great city-states from across the isle to the most sacred site in minotaur lore: Genisipago. Fighting atop the hill was forbidden, yet three archons were slain across the seven days by the will of the gods. On the seventh day, all present swore to stop the mass bloodshed between minotaurs, and the priests of Traxanos would lead the fierce minotaurs out of the isle to ravage faraway lands and return to the homeland with the riches acquired. Generally, the peace holds to this day.

## Minotaur Society
### Government
The Isle of Minotaurs is largely made up of independent city-states with varying forms of government. Classically, city-states have an Archon as the head of state, who may be elected, may have purchased the seat or who may have won the seat by might, which is largely impacted by the most popular deity. Stakonists typically support a government that is influenced by an electorate whereas Traxanoans respect strength and power.

The Council of Genisipago exists to this day, comprising the most powerful priests across the isle, but the council divorces itself from day-to-day management of minotaur society, meeting annually and only exerting their influence in hand-picked cases.

### City Structure
The old sections of their cities are labyrinths. It has been speculated that the founders of the cities made them into labyrinths to slow down invaders from capturing the city center, but the confirmation of that has been lost in time. As uncommon as non-minotaur humanoids roaming the cities are, none visit the city centers without a guide whereas minotaurs are able to navigate them almost instinctively. Newer sections of the cities were created more organically and don’t follow the same structure. Most cities have a seaport and are surrounded by farmland.

### Economy
The isle economy is varied, depending upon a mix of agrarian and mercantile sources. Minotaurs are well known for their shipwrighting and also their works of art, particularly pottery and frescoes depicting elements of their religion and society. What the minotaurs cannot source from the isle, they acquire via overseas trade or piracy.

### Maritime Culture
The blood red sails of minotaur ships sail the world raiding and trading. The captain has absolute authority over all, except the Dominator, aboard their ship and is judge, jury and executioner. The Dominator is the priest of Traxanos who performs religious rites and, most importantly, keeps the creatures of the Sea of Lost Souls at bay on voyages through the treacherous waters. Minotaurs have detailed charts of the Sea of Lost Souls to track the movements and territories of the cosmic horrors and other terrifying denizens, and Dominators communicate with each other to notify other vessels of any changes. The navigators chart courses through the sea like a labyrinth. Dominators maintain a beacon of warning to creatures of the sea to ensure safe passage, and they bring down the wrath of Traxanos for any who don’t heed the warning. If a Dominator fails in their task, they are sacrificed to the creatures. Captains typically avoid testing their authority against a Dominator because it usually ends fatally.
