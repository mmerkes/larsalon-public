# Lokada

Lokada, also known as the Peacekeeper, is the minotaur god of family, reconciliation, harvest, motherhood and childbirth. Followers of Lokada are largely responsible for the peace found in the Isle of Minotaurs as they typically mediate and influence disputes between competing city-states and factions. While Lokada doesn't wish to inflict minotaur piracy across the world, she excepts the need to redirect Traxanos and the belligerent away from the homeland. Lokada is typically depicted with a harvest basket or a baby.
