# Felengal, The Winged Harbinger

Felengal, the Winged Harbinger, is a primordial beast, typically represented as a multi-colored bird, and one of [the Ancients](../triads/the_ancients.md). Her origin is unknown, but legend has it that she presents herself as a bird warning of danger. Countless stories exist of the sound of a bird warning an unprepared victim of a surprise attack, and though nobody recollects more than a bird's call or flying birds, those grateful and still alive oftentimes recall the echo of an audible warning that only feels real in their dreams.
