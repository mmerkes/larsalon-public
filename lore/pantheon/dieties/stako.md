# Stako

Stako, also known is the Quiet One and the Philosopher, is the minotaur god of nature, knowledge, contemplation and philosophy. Followers of Stako are known to be quiet as they believe words should only be shared if they're important, and conciseness is considered a virtue. The exception are the great debates and symposiums organized by his followers. All the great minotaur philosophers worshipped Stako, and the great monastery on Mount Xon and the library at Tolos were built in his honor. Stako is also the preferred diety of those with a more natural inclination, experiencing the natural world to understand the universe. His followers persue knowledge and truths above all else.
