# Bralda, The Hearth Mother

Bralda, also known as The Hearth Mother, is the wife to Torug and mother of Vistrulda. She is the god of family, protection and loyalty. She is the matriarch of the Dwarven Three, and most high ranking dwarven council members defer to Bralda above the other gods. Devotees of Bralda see an efficiently run clan as a sign of their devotion and favor of their god, and live in service to their clan, frowning on expeditions away from the clan unless it's of the utmost importance.
