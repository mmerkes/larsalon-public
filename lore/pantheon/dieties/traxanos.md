# Traxanos

Traxanos, also known as the Sea Tyrant, is minotaur god of the seas, shipbuilding and war. His restless energy drives the minotaur exploration and violence. In early minotaur civilization, Traxanos drove minotaurs into a never ending cycle of war against one another. Lokada, the Peacekeeper, persauded Traxanos to lead the minotaurs to foreign lands, and a long age of peace at home and piracy abroad began and continues to this day. Traxanos is the patron of all pirates and is typically depicted holding a trident and honored on the prow of most minotaur vessels. His priests, called "Dominators" at sea, provide the key to sailing Sea of Lost Souls, commanding his holy might to subdue the terrifying denizens of the sea.
