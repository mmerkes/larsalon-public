# Syrax, The Night Serpent

Syrax, the Night Serpent, is a primordial beast, typically represented as a snake, and one of [the Ancients](../triads/the_ancients.md). Her origin is unknown, but legend has it that she presents herself at night when someone needs peace from life. Those who can convene with the dead have heard reports of soft whispers in the night calming them before releasing them from the living world. The only signs of the Night Serpent's visit is said to be a calm expression on the deceased face and two nearly imperceptible puncture wounds on the body.
