# The Wanderer

The Wanderer is a god of luck, travelers and good fortune. It is said that they wander the world secretly influencing its direction. Their final goals are unknown, if there are any at all. Some believe that the Wanderer is merely the facade of another god (or gods) acting in ways that wouldn't be seemly otherwise. Those who unexpectedly come into wealth are said to be favored by the Wanderer. Their influence can be as grand as dodging a natural disaster and as small as a single blade stroke getting pushed aside by a wild swing. Halfings often favor the Wanderer, though they have a more liberal interpretation of when the Wanderer is favoring you. It could be a pie forgotten on a window sill or a purse of coins not properly fastened to someone's waist belt.
