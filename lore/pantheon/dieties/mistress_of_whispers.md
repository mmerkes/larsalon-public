### Hidden Temple

The greatest mystery all followers of the Mistress pursue is access to her secret temple. It is said that those who make it to the hidden temple meet the Mistress herself, so only the most followers throughout history have ever reached the temple.

#### Rumour: Hidden Access in Beneath Valindor

In the early days of Valindor, the city's greatest mage, Mojenreese, placed hidden portals underneath the city that lead to different places across the world, different planes and even across time. Those who know about the location of a portal keep it a closely guarded secret. When discovered, studying the clues left behind on the portal may take years before anyone can figure out how to use the portal, and it can be risky going through as it could lead to certain death or unending torture.

Many followers of the Mistress believe that Mojenreese was also a high priest of the Mistress and may have created a portal to the hidden temple.
