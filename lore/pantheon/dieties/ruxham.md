# Ruxham, The Guardian

Ruxham, also known as the Guardian, is a primordial beast, typically represented as a ram, and one of [the Ancients](../triads/the_ancients.md). His origin is unknown, but legend has it that he presents himself at times when someone needs protection. It is unclear why or when he may intervene, and the only evidence of his presence may be hoof prints and a blungeoned beast.

Oftentimes, reported sightings occur in a natural places disturbed by outsiders. The destruction or threat of destruction are said to call upon the fury of Ruxham.
