# The Ancients

The Ancients are primordial beasts of unknown origin. Some say that they were created along with the world of Trisoria as its immortal protectors, maintaining balance and appearing in great times of need. Others believe that they are merely avatars of the gods and show up when convenient to any given god.

Regardless of their actual origin, the myths and legends of the Ancients permuates throughout cultures on Larsalon, giving credence to their existence in some fashion. While you may find shrines to the Ancients and folk may pray to them, you don't see them worshiped by formal religions as clerics and paladins can't draw power from them. Some druids favor the Ancients and find some connection with them.
