# Elsir Vale History

## Notable Powers

### [The Three Clans Dwarven Kingdom](the_three_clans_dwarven_kingdoms.md)

An ancient dwarf-kingdom that spanned the Wyrmsmoke and Giantshield Mountains more than a thousand years ago and built most of the roadways, the city of Overlook and the fortresses in the pass. After the dwarf-realm passed, the presence of various monsters and raiders kept traffic along the Dawn Way light for many years; few caravans dared the long and dangerous trek. Few humans lived in Elsir Vale during those years—only scattered settlements of druidic folk who left behind little more than grassy barrows and stone circles on the hilltops.

### Kingdom of Rhestilor

About six hundred years ago, the nearby city of Rhest came to control the vale and a large swath of land north of the Giantshield Mountains as well. Soldiers from Rhest secured the roads all the way to Dennovar and beyond, creating a safe passage for trade. Under the kingdom's shield, the towns along the Dawn Way—Brindol, Talar, Terrelton, and the rest—grew up from tiny hamlets or lonely soldiers' posts to flourishing human settlements. As the Dawn Way became an important route for trade, the kingdom of Rhestilor grew wealthy on the tariffs exacted from the passing merchants. Eventually, Rhestilor integrated with the Larsalon Empire peacefully to avoid conflict and secure wealthy trade contracts.

The Larsalon Empire had a small presence in the Elsir Vale. While the Kingdom of Rhestilor joined the Larsalon Empire, it was mostly left to its own devices as long as trade moved along the Dawn Way as expected.

Rhestilor eventually collapsed under civil strife, monstrous incursions, and magical blights. Over four hundred years ago, the city of Rhest was burned by a savage horde out of the Wyrmsmoke Mountains. Although the warriors of Rhestilor killed many of the goblins and their kind, the city was abandoned and the already weakened kingdom broken. A few years later, the whole Larsalon Empire collapsed as well. Since then, the towns of Elsir Vale came to look after themselves. While most of the local lords still hold titles derived from the old kingdom of Rhestilor and everyone knows that the kings of Rhestilor were long dead, no new realm has arisen in the Vale.
