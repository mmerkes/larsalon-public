# The Three Clans Dwarven Kingdom

The Three Clans Dwarven Kingdom was an ancient dwarven kingdom ruled by the Ironhide clan, the Giantsbane Clan and the Runeforge Clan (originally the Iceheart Clan). The kingdom spanned the Wyrmsmoke and Giantshield Mountains more than a thousand years ago and built most of the roadways, the city of Overlook and the fortresses in the pass. After the dwarf-realm passed, the presence of various monsters and raiders kept traffic along the Dawn Way light for many years; few caravans dared the long and dangerous trek. Few humans lived in Elsir Vale during those yearsâ€”only scattered settlements of druidic folk who left behind little more than grassy barrows and stone circles on the hilltops.

## Origin

Long ago, the kingdom was founded by the Ironhide clan. The kingdom split into three clans when the queen was blessed with triplet sons, and the king named one the heir to the Ironhide clan and tasked the other two sons to found sister empires: one based in the far side of the Wyrmsmoke Mountains and another in the Giantshield Mountains. The Iceheart clan and Runeforge clan were founded when the sons came of age. While the Ironhide clan ruled the kingdom as the original and greatest power, the three clans largely operated independently.

## Scions of the Runeforge

The Scions of the Runeforge are six legendary dwarven artifacts crafted long ago on the Runeforge. It is said that the power of the Scions kept the kingdoms together by driving away the many hordes from outside and inside the mountains. However, the Scions ultimately led to the kingdom's downfall. See [Fall of the Kingdoms](#fall-of-the-kingdoms) for more information.

TODO: Create the known artifacts.

The Scions are a highly studied topic in the Elsir Vale among dwarvens, and any information, regardless of how legitimate, is highly coveted by the remaining dwarves.

## Fall of the Kingdom

Ambitious second sons of the three ruling clans attempted to start their own clans. After the clan heads refused to consider splitting the clans, the three second sons conspired to each steal a Scion of the Runeforge to give them the power to found their own clans. While the three clan heads met on regular business, three Scions were stolen by the second sons and taken off into the mountains.

With three Scions stolen, the clans blamed each other for the stolen artifacts and the Giantsbane and Runeforge clans seceded from the kingdom to form their own. With all three clans over-extending resources to track down the artifacts and the loss of the power those artifacts provided, the clans struggled to fend off forces assaulting their strongholds and keeping the roads safe. The final straw fell when the Ironhide clan recovered an artifact originally owned by the Runeforge clan and refused to return it. The Ironhide and Runeforge clans went to war over the artifact while the Giantsbane also tried to make a play for it. The war didn't last long as hordes coming down from the mountains finished off the weakened dwarves.

## Living Remnants of the Kingdom

At the time of the kingdom, the Hammerfist Holds were founded as an outpost of the kingdom by a few lesser clans. They were not as rich as the settlements in the Wyrmsmoke and Giantshield Mountains and had no political power. Due to that lack of power or significance within the empire, the Hammerfist Holds were insulated from the power struggles between the ruling clans and were largely forgotten until they served as a refuge for any surviving dwarves not too proud to turn to them for help.
