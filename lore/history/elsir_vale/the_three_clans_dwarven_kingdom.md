# The Three Clans Dwarven Kingdom

The Three Clans Dwarven Kingdom was an ancient dwarven kingdom ruled by the Ironhide clan, the Giantsbane Clan and the Runeforge Clan (originally the Iceheart Clan). The kingdom spanned the Wyrmsmoke and Giantshield Mountains more than a thousand years ago and built most of the roadways, the city of Overlook and the fortresses in the pass.

## Origin

Over a thousand years ago, the kingdom was founded by the Ironhide clan. The kingdom split into three clans when the queen was blessed with triplet sons, and the king named one the heir (King Grunshoer I) to the Ironhide clan and tasked the other two sons to found sister clans: one based in the far side of the Wyrmsmoke Mountains and another in the Giantshield Mountains. The Giantsbane clan and Iceheart (later Runeforge) clan were founded when Duggerdon and Thundeer, respectively, came of age. While the Ironhide clan ruled the kingdom as the original and greatest power, the three clans largely operated independently.

## Scions of the Runeforge

The Scions of the Runeforge are six legendary dwarven artifacts crafted long ago on the Runeforge. It is said that the power of the Scions kept the kingdoms together by driving away the many hordes from outside and inside the mountains. However, the Scions ultimately led to the kingdom's downfall. See [Fall of the Kingdoms](#fall-of-the-kingdoms) for more information.

Legend has it that Thundeer, a devout priest of Torug the Forge Father and a dwarf in his middle years working to solidify his newly established stronghold, fell deathly ill and experienced fevered dreams. Many expected him to die, but after the fifth night, he woke up, fever gone. He immediately started giving crazed orders to a construct a new forge and forced he clan to work day and night. Once the construction completed, he worked tirelessly for seven days inscribing runes into the forge, a hammer and an anvil. Then, he told his brothers that Torug demanded great riches from them, and after they refused, both brothers fell ill for three, and when they recovered, they mined the ores and minerals themselves. Finally, the first of the three Scions of the Runeforge were made by the three brothers. While it is commonly agreed upon that there were six artifacts in total, only the three original pieces are known:

* **The Mithril Crown:** The Mithril Crown was gifted to King Grunshoer I of the Ironhide clan and was passed down to the heir of the kingdom until lost at the fall.
* **The King's Fist:** The King's Fist was the hereditary weapon of the head of the Giantsbane clan. It was said to be a mighty warhammer, but the actual properties are unknown.
* **The King's Ward:** The King's Ward was the hereditary shield of the head of the Runeforge clan. Thundeer crafted the shield for himself as a demonstration to King Grunshoer I that the Runeforge served the king and that he had no designs of upsetting the power balance.

The remaining three Scions are unknown. There has been much speculation, but they were crafted much later than the original three and records during the final days of the kingdom references conflict each other. "The Star of Dransmoren" and "Fang" are mentioned as possible items, but it's unclear what they were.

The Scions are a highly studied topic in the Elsir Vale among dwarvens, and any information, regardless of how legitimate, is highly coveted by the remaining dwarves. The Runeforge and the Scions have been lost, though many have died searching for them. Finding any of the artifacts would be a mighty treasure. Followers of [Vistrulda](../../pantheon/dieties/vistrulda.md) have made it their mission to search for signs of the Scions whereas finding the Runeforge has turned into a pilgrimage for followers of [Torug](../../pantheon/dieties/vistrulda.md). While the search for the Scions has only yielded frustration, Torug's faithful appreciate the edification of the search even though the destination has not be reached.

It is theorized that with the Runeforge and Thundeer's Hammer, if they could be found, new great magic items could be created. It is hotly debated among priests of Torug if the skill and knowledge still exists in this day to relight the forge and craft new magic items to match the power of the Scions.

## Fall of the Kingdom

Ambitious second sons of the three ruling clans attempted to start their own clans. After the clan heads refused to consider splitting the clans, the three second sons conspired to each steal a Scion of the Runeforge to give them the power to found their own clans. While the three clan heads met on regular business, three Scions were stolen by the second sons and taken off into the mountains.

With three Scions stolen, the clans blamed each other for the stolen artifacts and the Giantsbane and Runeforge clans seceded from the kingdom to form their own kingdoms. With all three clans over-extending resources to track down the artifacts and the loss of the power those artifacts provided, the clans struggled to fend off forces assaulting their strongholds and keeping the roads safe. The final straw fell when the Ironhide clan recovered an artifact originally owned by the Runeforge clan and refused to return it. The Ironhide and Runeforge clans went to war over the artifact while the Giantsbane also tried to make a play for it. The war didn't last long as hordes coming down from the mountains finished off the weakened dwarves.

## Living Remnants of the Kingdom

At the height of the kingdom, the Hammerfist Holds were founded as an outpost of the kingdom by a few lesser clans. They were not as rich as the settlements in the Wyrmsmoke and Giantshield Mountains and had no political power. Due to that lack of power or significance within the kingdom, the Hammerfist Holds were insulated from the power struggles between the ruling clans and were largely forgotten until they served as a refuge for any surviving dwarves not too proud to turn to them for help.
